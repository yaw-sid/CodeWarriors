## Use Case Abstract
<!--- Template Instructions  
  Provide a brief description of the use case tackled by the team.
--->
 Accessibility testing is often done after development is complete, which can result in costly and time-consuming fixes. This is because developers either have to manually review a long list of accessibility standards or use paid tools that generate test results based on a website's URL.

To solve this problem, we developed Accessify, a solution that integrates accessibility testing into the development process. Accessify is designed for frontend developers who use HTML and CSS to implement user interfaces.
## Project Artifacts
<!--- Template Instructions  
  Complete the table below. Replace URLs where necessary.
